The Income Tax Act offers various opportunities for taxpayers to avail of deductions and decrease their tax obligations. With efficient tax planning, you can save significant amounts of taxes. Here’s how you can save tax on Rs 15 lakh annual salary.  The income earned up-to Rs.12 Lakhs will ultimately have Nil tax liability. The grounds are explained as follows. The modified slab rates for new tax regime applicable for FY 2025-2026 is as follows: Income Tax Slabs Tax Rate Up-to Rs. 4,00,000 NIL Rs. 4,00,001 - Rs. 8,00,000 5% Rs. 8,00,001 - Rs. 12,00,000 10% Rs. 12,00,001 - Rs. 16,00,000 15% Rs. 16,00,001 - Rs. 20,00,000 20% Rs. 20,00,001 - Rs. 24,00,000 25% Above Rs. 24,00,000 30% So as per the above table, the Basic Exemption Limit is extended to Rs.4,00,000. The rebate allowed under section 87A has now been increased to Rs.60,000 for new regime. This was Rs.25,000 before the change. Since the rebate allowed has been increased, tax incidence for income up-to Rs.12,00,000 will be zero.  Marginal relief on rebate is still applicable. As per the latest Finance Act 2024, changes have been made in the slab rate for the new tax regime applicable for FY 24-25 as follows -  Tax Slab  Tax Rate Upto ₹ 3 lakh Nil ₹ 3 lakh - ₹ 7 lakh 5% ₹ 7 lakh - ₹ 10 lakh 10% ₹ 10 lakh - ₹ 12 lakh  15% ₹ 12 lakh - ₹ 15 lakh 20% more than ₹ 15 lakh 30% In the new tax regime, the standard deduction has been increased from Rs.50,000 to Rs.75,000, and the deduction on family pension has also been increased from Rs.15,000 to Rs.25,000.  The old regime allows for several deductions that are not available in the new one.
