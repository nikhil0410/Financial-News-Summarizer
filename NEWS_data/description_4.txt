Though the new regime is now the default tax regime, the old tax regime will continue to exist. The income earned up-to Rs.12 Lakhs under new regime will ultimately have Nil tax liability. Here's how! The modified slab rates for new tax regime applicable for FY 2025-2026 are as follows: Income Tax Slabs Tax Rates Up-to Rs. 4,00,000 NIL Rs. 4,00,001 - Rs. 8,00,000 5% Rs. 8,00,001 - Rs. 12,00,000 10% Rs. 12,00,001 - Rs. 16,00,000 15% Rs. 16,00,001 - Rs. 20,00,000 20% Rs. 20,00,001 - Rs. 24,00,000 25% Above Rs. 24,00,000 30% Check out the beneficial regime for you based on the income and deduction level in the table below!  Note: First column contains income levels and first row contains deduction amount. The above table applies only for FY 2025-2026. A new tax regime was introduced in Budget 2020 wherein the tax slabs were altered, and taxpayers were offered concessional tax rates. However, those who opt for the new regime cannot claim several exemptions and deductions, such as HRA, LTA, 80C, 80D , and more. Because of this, the new tax regime did not have many takers. The government in the Budget 2023 introduced 5 key changes, which remain the same even for FY 2024-2025 since no changes were made in the Interim Budget 2024, to encourage taxpayers to adopt the new regime. They are: Tax Slab for FY 2024-25 Tax Rate Upto  Rs. 3,00,000  Nil Rs. 3,00,001  - Rs. 7,00,000 5% Rs. 7,00,001 - Rs. 10,00,000  10% Rs. 10,00,001 - Rs. 12,00,000  15% Rs. 12,00,001 - Rs. 15,00,000 20% More than 15,00,000 30% Budget 2024 has increased the standard deduction under the new tax regime to Rs. 75,000. The family pension deduction has also been increased from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 25,000. With the revised tax structure the taxpayer will save Rs.17,500.    Old Tax Regime (FY 2024-25) New Tax Regime Income Slabs Age < 60 years & NRIs Age of 60 Years to 80 years Age above 80 Years FY 2024-25 Up to Rs.2,50,000 NIL NIL NIL NIL Rs.2,50,001 - Rs.3,00,000 5% NIL NIL NIL Rs.3,00,001 - Rs.5,00,000 5% 5% NIL 5% Rs.5,00,001 - Rs.6,00,000 20% 20% 20% 5% Rs.6,00,001 - Rs.7,00,000 20% 20% 20% 5% Rs.7,00,001 - Rs.7,50,000 20% 20% 20% 10% Rs.7,50,001 - Rs.9,00,000 20% 20% 20% 10% Rs.9,00,001 - Rs.10,00,000 20% 20% 20% 10% Rs.10,00,001 - Rs.12,00,000 30% 30% 30% 15% Rs.12,00,001 - Rs.12,50,000 30% 30% 30% 20% Rs.12,50,001 - Rs.15,00,000 30% 30% 30% 20% Rs.15,00,000 and above 30% 30% 30% 30% The old regime is the tax system that prevailed before the introduction of the new regime. Under this regime, there are over 70 exemptions and deductions available, including HRA and LTA, that can reduce your taxable income and lower tax payments. The most popular and generous deduction is Section 80C, which allows for a reduction of taxable income up to Rs.1.5 lakh. The taxpayers are given a choice between the old and the new tax regime. The decision to switch to the new or remain in the old tax regime or which regime is better for you shall be based on the tax savings deductions and exemptions you are eligible for in the old tax regime. To make it easier, we have calculated a breakeven point for various income levels (refer to the table below) for a salaried individual below 60 years of age. This can be used to determine which regime to choose. The table below shows which tax regime is more beneficial at various income levels and deduction amounts. If you have Salary Income:  Here are a few calculations that will help you decide between the old vs the new tax regime: When Total Deductions are Rs.1.75 Lakhs or Less: The New Tax Regime will be Beneficial  When Total Deductions are More Than Rs. 4.5 Lakhs: The Old Tax Regime will be Beneficial  When Total Deductions are Between Rs.1.75 Lakhs to Rs.4.5 Lakhs: Will Depend on Various Income Levels  Here is a quick insight into the comparison between the deductions and exemptions available under the new and the old tax regime:   Particulars Old Tax Regime         New tax Regime (until 31st March 2023)       New Tax Regime   (FY 2023-24) New Tax Regime   (FY 2024-25)   Income level for rebate eligibility Rs. 5 lakhs Rs. 5 lakhs Rs. 7 lakhs Rs. 7 lakhs Standard Deduction Rs. 50,000 - Rs. 50,000 Rs. 75,000 Effective Tax-Free Salary income Rs. 5.5 lakhs Rs. 5 lakhs Rs. 7.5 lakhs Rs. 7.75 lakhs Rebate u/s 87A Rs.12,500 Rs.12,500 Rs.25,000 Rs.25,000 HRA Exemption ✓ X X X Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) ✓ X X X Other allowances including food allowance of Rs 50/meal subject to 2 meals a day ✓ X X X Standard Deduction  ✓ X ✓ ✓ Entertainment Allowance and Professional Tax ✓ X X X Perquisites for official purposes ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Interest on Home Loan u/s 24b on: Self-occupied or vacant property ✓ X X X Interest on Home Loan u/s 24b on: Let-out property ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Deduction u/s 80C (EPF | LIC | ELSS | PPF | FD | Children's tuition fee etc) ✓ X X X Employee's (own) contribution to NPS ✓ X X X Employer's contribution to NPS ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Medical insurance premium - 80D ✓ X X X Disabled Individual - 80U ✓ X X X Interest on education loan - 80E ✓ X X X Interest on Electric vehicle loan - 80EEB ✓ X X X Donation to Political party/trust etc - 80G ✓ X X X Savings Bank Interest u/s 80TTA and 80TTB ✓ X X X Other Chapter VI-A deductions ✓ X X X All contributions to Agniveer Corpus Fund - 80CCH ✓ Did not exist ✓ ✓ Deduction on Family Pension Income ✓ X ✓ ✓ Gifts upto Rs 50,000 ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Exemption on voluntary retirement 10(10C) ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Exemption on gratuity u/s 10(10) ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Exemption on Leave encashment u/s 10(10AA) ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Daily Allowance ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Conveyance Allowance ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Transport Allowance for a specially-abled person ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ When deciding between the two tax regimes, it is important to take into account the tax exemptions and deductions available under the old tax regime. After deducting all eligible exemptions and deductions, the net taxable income can be determined. By calculating the tax liability based on this net taxable income under the old tax regime, it becomes possible to compare it with the tax liability under the new tax regime. Choosing the regime with the lower tax liability is the logical approach, and it is essential to inform the employer about this choice so that the appropriate Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) can be deducted from the salary. If you have a loss from house property, capital gains, or business & profession, you need to consider them as well while making informed decisions on the selection of regime. Along with the current year's losses, even the previous year's losses eligible to set off will get lapsed as well. Ineligibility to carry forward such losses may impact your future income determination and taxes thereon. Many individuals often find themselves questioning the disparities between the old and new tax regimes. The new income tax regime is designed to accommodate those who have more personal commitments such as repayment of personal/vehicle loans, medical treatment of parents or dependents, or wish to avoid the burden of extensive tax preparation or have minimal tax deductions due to their ineligibility for section 10 exemptions, standard deductions, tax on employment, employer contribution to pension scheme etc., Conversely, the old tax regime can yield more tax savings for senior citizens, who derive a substantial portion of their income from interest, can benefit from Section 80TTB, which allows them to claim Rs.50,000 as interest income deduction and feel more secure under the old tax regime. Both the old and new tax regimes possess advantages and disadvantages. The previous tax structure encourages taxpayers to cultivate a habit of saving, while the new tax structure favours employees with lower earnings and investments, resulting in fewer deductions and exemptions. The new tax system is considered safer and simpler, involving fewer records and reducing the potential for tax evasion fraud. However, due to the unique nature of individual deductions and exemptions, a thorough comparison of the two regimes is necessary to determine the best fit for each person.

It has a higher tax rate but allows taxpayers to claim tax benefits on various investments and expenses.  The new tax regime is a simplified tax structure introduced in Budget 2020, under which taxpayers can pay lower taxes but have to forego maximum deductions and exemptions. The new tax regime has lower tax rates than the old regime but eliminates the tax benefits of various investments and expenses.  Yes, taxpayers can switch between the old and new tax regimes every year at the time of filing their tax returns. However, once you opt for the new tax regime for a year, you cannot claim any tax benefits available in the old tax regime. However, if the Individuals with income from business and profession once opted for the new tax regime in any of the previous FYs and in the current FY opts for the old tax regime then it is not allowed to switch back to the new tax regime in any of the subsequent FYs. If you have an income of Rs 7 lakhs, the new tax regime will benefit you.  If you have an income of Rs 10 lakhs, the old tax regime will benefit you only if you have made tax savings investments (deductions other than standard deductions) of over Rs 2,62,500.  If these deductions are less than Rs 2,62,500, then the new regime will be better for you.  The old tax regime is good for you if you have invested more than Rs 3,12,500 in tax-saving schemes. If you have invested or spent less than Rs 3,12,500, then the new regime will be better for you.  Which regime is better for you will depend on the amount of tax-saving investments you have made:  If you have an income of Rs 20 lakhs, the best regime for you will depend on the tax deductions you are eligible for:  If you have an income of Rs 25 lakhs, the best regime for you will depend on the tax deductions you are eligible for: If you have an income of Rs 30 lakhs, the new regime will benefit you if your tax deductions are less than Rs 3,75,000. Otherwise, opt in for the old tax regime.  If you have an income of Rs 50 lakhs, the old regime will be beneficial for you if your total tax saving deductions are Rs 3,75,000 or more. Otherwise, opt-in for the new tax regime.   One can claim few selective deductions under the new tax regime for FY 2023-24 such as standard deduction of Rs.50,000, interest on Home Loan u/s 24b on let-out property, employer’s contribution to NPS u/s 80CCD, Contributions to Agniveer Corpus Fund u/s 80CCH, Deduction on Family Pension Income (lower of 1/3rd of actual pension or 15,000) is applicable for the FY 23-24.   No, HRA exemption u/s10(13A) is not allowed in the new tax regime.
