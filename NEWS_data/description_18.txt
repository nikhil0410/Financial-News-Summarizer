Income Tax Slabs in Budget 2025: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced on Saturday during the Union Budget 2025 that no income tax will be payable on earnings up to Rs 12 lakh, or up to Rs 12.75 lakh including standard deductions, under the new regime. With the new tweaks being introduced, a taxpayer in the new regime with an income of ₹12 lakh will get a benefit of ₹80,000 in tax (100% of tax payable as per existing rates will be exempt). The effective income tax rate will be 0%. Hence, the move essentially means even if people earning between Rs 8 to 10 lakh end up paying a 10% tax in the new tax regime, they can claim a refund of the entire value, making their payable income tax Rs 0. Also, effectively those earning up to Rs 13 lakh will now be able to save income tax over and above the Rs 12 lakh income limit as there is a standard deduction of Rs 75,000 and a marginal relief of around 30,000. Notably, earlier there was a 30% tax on those earning above Rs 15 lakh under both regimes. Now, there is a 25% slab for those earning between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 24 lakh. The Centre’s move to change the tax slabs in the Union Budget 2025 is aimed at reducing taxes for the middle class and leaving more money in their hands, boosting household consumption, savings, and investment. Here’s a look at the new tax rates for people earning more than Rs 12 lakh per annum.   Here’s a table highlighting the new tax slabs in the new tax regime:    The Finance Minister has announced significant changes to tax deduction at source (TDS) in the 2025-26 Budget, aimed at easing compliance for senior citizens and those earning rental income.  The annual TDS exemption limit on rental income has been raised from Rs 2.4 lakh to Rs 6 lakh. “This will reduce the number of transactions subject to TDS, benefiting small taxpayers receiving smaller payments," Sitharaman explained in her Budget speech.    As per the new announcement, the old tax regime remains the same. Here are the current tax slabs under the old tax regime:  The Old Tax Regime, while retaining higher rates, has allowed taxpayers to claim various exemptions and deductions. Here are the slabs:    For senior citizens aged 60-80 years, the basic exemption limit is Rs 3,00,000. For super senior citizens (above 80 years), it is Rs 5,00,000.  The Old Tax Regime allows deductions under various sections, such as:  Section 80C: Up to Rs 1,50,000 for investments like PPF, ELSS, and LIC premiums.  Section 80D: Health insurance premiums.  Section 24(b): Interest on home loan up to Rs 2,00,000. Swipe Left For Next Video  Other exemptions like HRA and LTA. Latest Blogs
