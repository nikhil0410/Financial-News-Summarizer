At present, there are two tax regimes operational in the country. The taxpayers now have the choice to pick a tax regime that can help them save more money. If you haven’t made any choice, you will be shifted to the new tax regime by default.  If you want to know how to save tax on a 1 crore salary, this is just for you.  The income earned up-to Rs.12 Lakhs under new regime will ultimately have Nil tax liability. Here's how! The modified slab rates for new tax regime applicable for FY 2025-2026 are as follows: Income Tax Slabs Tax Rates Up-to Rs. 4,00,000 NIL Rs. 4,00,001 - Rs. 8,00,000 5% Rs. 8,00,001 - Rs. 12,00,000 10% Rs. 12,00,001 - Rs. 16,00,000 15% Rs. 16,00,001 - Rs. 20,00,000 20% Rs. 20,00,001 - Rs. 24,00,000 25% Above Rs. 24,00,000 30% As per the new income tax guidelines, you can opt for either the new or the old regime while filing your taxes. Here is a difference between the two: Tax Slab FY 2024-25 Tax Rate (Old tax regime) Tax Slab FY 2024-25 Tax Rate (New tax regime) Up to Rs 2,50,000 Nil Up to Rs 3,00,000 Nil Rs 2,50,000 – Rs 5,00,000 5% Rs 3,00,001 – Rs 7,00,000 5% Rs 5,00,000 – Rs 10,00,000 20% Rs 7,00,001 – Rs 10,00,000 10% Rs 10,00,000 and beyond 30% Rs 10,00,001 – Rs 12,00,000 15% NA NA Rs 12,00,001 – Rs 15,00,000 20% NA NA Rs 15,00,001 and beyond 30% Note: If you file your taxes according to the new regime, you cannot avail most of the tax benefits. To calculate your tax liability using both regimes, you may use the old vs new tax regime calculator.  Here are the points to note under the New Tax Regime if you are a salaried individual having more than Rs 1 crore Salary:  If you fall above 1 crore tax slab, here is the tax slab under the old regime. Here are few Points to Note  Standard Deduction  Rs. 50,000 available for all the salaried employees.

But this is just to give you a brief idea of the most commonly availed exemptions and deductions. Irrespective of the regime you choose, you can consider the below points to derive maximum benefits of the deductions available under the Income Tax Act.  The following table describes the quantum of deduction available under both the regimes for contributions made by the employer in the NPS scheme under section 80CCD (2) Particulars Central / State Government Employer Other Employer Old Regime 14% of salary (basic + DA) 10% of salary (basic + DA) New Regime 14% of salary (basic + DA) 14% of salary (basic + DA) Deduction under section 80JJA is available irrespective of choice of regime of the assessee. 30% of the amount expended on additional employees can be allowed as a deduction.   Let’s take an example for better understanding:  Mr. A has a Salary income of Rs.1.2 Crores. He is also claiming the following deduction and exemption. Calculate tax liability under the Old Tax Regime and New Tax Regime Particular Old tax regime New Tax regime Gross Salary u/s 17(1) 1,20,00,000 1,20,00,000 Less: Exemption u/s 10 HRA Exemption 1,80,000 ❌ LTA Exemption 55,000 ❌ Children's education and hostel allowance 9,600 ❌ Less: Deduction u/s 16 Standard deduction 50,000 75,000 Profession Tax 2,400 ❌ Income under the Head Salary 1,17,03,000 1,19,25,000 Less: Deduction under Chapter VI-A Section 80C 1,50,000 ❌ Section 80D 50,000 ❌ Section 80E 50,000 ❌ Net Total Income 1,14,53,000 1,19,25,000 Income Tax (Including Surcharge) 37,35,660 37,57,625 Tax Liability (Including Cess) 38,85,100 39,07,930 In the above calculation, the tax under the Old Tax Regime is lower than the New Tax Regime. This is due to the deductions and exemptions claimed and allowed under the Old Tax Regime. Careful comparison according to the specific Individual must be made before opting for the appropriate Tax Regime. Now that you are aware of the two operational tax regimes, you can easily do your tax planning for a salary above Rs 1 crore. There are several schemes, especially under the old tax regime, that can help you substantially bring down your tax liability. On the other hand, the multiple slabs under the new regime can help you avail lower tax rates. Make sure to plan everything well in advance so that you do not miss out on tax savings.  Related Articles: How To Save Tax For Salary Above 7 Lakhs?How To Save Tax For Salary Above 10 Lakhs?How To Save Tax For Salary Above 12 Lakhs?How To Save Tax For Salary Above 13 Lakhs?How To Save Tax For Salary Above 15 lakhs?How To Save Tax For Salary Above 20 Lakhs?How To Save Tax For Salary Above 30 Lakhs?How To Save Tax For Salary Above 50 Lakhs?
