In this article, we have detailed the significant changes that will take effect following the recent budget announcement. The new Income Tax Bill has been tabled by the Honorable Finance Minister in the Lok Sabha. It aims to simplification and better presentation of the provisions. The Income Tax Bill introduces the concept of Tax Year.  As per the budget 2025, the income up to Rs. 12,00,000 will have zero tax liability for the FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27) under the new tax regime. Here's how: The revised tax slabs under the new regime for FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27) are as follows: Annual Income Tax Slabs income Tax Rates Upto Rs. 4,00,000 NIL Rs. 4,00,001 - Rs. 8,00,000 5% Rs. 8,00,001 - Rs. 12,00,000 10% Rs. 12,00,001 - Rs. 16,00,000  15% Rs. 16,00,001 - Rs. 20,00,000 20% Rs. 20,00,001 - Rs. 24,00,000 25% Above Rs. 24,00,000  30% With the revised tax structure, individuals earning up to Rs. 12,00,000 will have no tax liability due to the increased rebate of Rs. 60,000. For salaried individuals, the tax liability will be zero for incomes up to Rs. 12,75,000, due to the Rs. 75,000 standard deduction. Note: According to the announcement made under the latest budget, the revised tax slab applies to the new tax regime. The corresponding changes from April 1, 2024, are highlighted below. Total Income Tax rate ₹0 to ₹3,00,000 0% ₹3,00,001 to ₹7,00,000 5% ₹7,00,001 to ₹10,00,000 10% ₹10,00,001 to ₹12,00,000 15% ₹12,00,001 to ₹15,00,000 20% Above ₹15,00,000 30% The following are the advantages of the new tax regime to taxpayers: The following table shows the updated surcharge rate according to the new tax regime: Taxable Income Limit Surcharge Rate on the Value of Income Tax Before Introducing Budget 2023 After Introducing Budget 2023 < ₹50 lakhs 0% 0% ₹50 lakhs to ₹1 Crore 10% 10% ₹1 Crore to ₹2 Crore 15% 15% ₹2 Crore to ₹5 Crore 25% 25% > ₹5 Crore     37%      25% The introduction of the new tax regime has increased the rebate limit. As per the old tax regime, the applicable rebate limit is Rs.12,500 for incomes up to Rs.5 lakhs. However, under the new tax regime, this rebate limit has increased to Rs.25,000 if the taxable income is less than or equal to Rs.7 lakhs. Note that the Section 87A rebate is applicable under both income tax regimes. Then, the budget announcement increased the taxable limit to Rs.7 lakhs from Rs.5 lakhs under the new tax regime. Salaried individuals' standard deduction under the old regime is Rs.50,000, whereas in the case of the new regime, the limit has been increased to Rs. 75,000 for the FY 2024-25. Under the new tax regime, you will obtain an exemption on leave encashment. In the budget 2023, the exemption limit for leave encashment was raised 8 times i.e. from Rs. 3 lakhs to Rs. 25 lakhs for non-government employees. So, at retirement, the leave encashment amounting up to Rs. 25 lakhs is free from tax, as per Section 10(10AA).  Budget 2024 has made significant changes on the tax implications on the capital gains which are as under: The presumptive scheme of taxation is a simplified method provided by tax authorities to compute taxable income for certain eligible businesses or professions. Under this scheme, taxpayers are allowed to declare income at a prescribed rate based on certain presumptions rather than maintaining detailed books of accounts and undergoing complex calculations.
