In recent times, there has been relaxation of slab rates, extension of deductions available to salary income, and other deductions made available to assessees which would help to save taxes.  Check out the below article to know all the tax saving options available for the income range of Rs.13,00,000. Please note that this article applies only to tax implications pertaining to the financial year 2025-26 only.   The salary income earned up to Rs.12.75 Lakhs will ultimately have Nil tax liability. Here's how! As per the latest Finance Act 2025, changes have been made in the slab rate for the new tax regime applicable for FY 25-26 as follows -  Income Tax Slabs Tax Rate Up to Rs. 4,00,000 NIL Rs. 4,00,001 - Rs. 8,00,000 5% Rs. 8,00,001 - Rs. 12,00,000 10% Rs. 12,00,001 - Rs. 16,00,000 15% Rs. 16,00,001 - Rs. 20,00,000 20% Rs. 20,00,001 - Rs. 24,00,000 25% Above Rs. 24,00,000 30% There have been no changes made in Budget 2025 in the old tax regime slab rates.

Maturity proceeds are tax-exempt if the sum assured is ≤: – 20%: policies issued before 1 April 2012 – 10%: policies issued after 1 April 2012 – 15%: policies issued after 1 April 2013 for a person with disability or disease. Let us understand the tax calculations on the salary of Rs.13 lakh based on the example given below. Example: Mr. A (works in a private company) has a salary income of Rs 13 lakhs claiming deductions like HRA of Rs. 1,00,000, LTA of Rs. 20,000, Children's education allowance for two children of Rs. 9,600, Professional tax of Rs 2,400. He has also claimed deductions like 80C of Rs. 150,000, 80D - Medical insurance premium of Rs. 25,000, and NPS contribution of Rs 50,000. The employer has contributed to NPS of Rs.1,00,000 which is included in salary. Assuming in the current illustration that his basic pay for the year is Rs.6,80,000. After calculations, the deduction u/s 80CCD(2) comes to Rs.95,200 (14% of Rs.6,80,000) for the new regime and Rs.68,000 (10% of Rs.6,80,000)  for the old regime respectively.  Which is the best tax regime to opt for in this case? 13,70,000 13,70,000 1,00,000 ❌ 20,000 ❌ 9,600 ❌ 50,000 75,000 2,400 ❌ 11,18,000 12,95,000 1,50,000 ❌ 50,000 ❌ 25,000 ❌ 68,000 95,200 8,25,000 11,99,800 77,500 59,980 Not Applicable 59,980 80,600 NIL It can be inferred that in the above case, the new tax regime is more beneficial because of significant relaxation made in slab rates in Budget 2025. This benefit has arisen despite deductions available under the old regime. The tax rates as proposed in the Budget 2025 has significantly reduced the tax burden of salaried employees who earn income around Rs.12 to 13 lakhs. It has reduced  the compliance burden and the tax burden for tax payers significantly. This is expected to increase savings, consumption and investments in the economy. Which is a win-win situation for both the tax payers and the government.

This will reduce your taxable income or might as well make your tax liability zero.  For a salary income of Rs. 14 Lakhs (assuming that you have no other income) the tax liability will be Rs. 81,900. However, if you have Employer's NPS contribution then it can be claimed as a deduction u/s 80CCD(2) upto 14% of Basic Salary. This will reduce your tax liability.  Contribution to PF can be claimed as a deduction u/s 80C upto Rs. 1,50,000 only under the Old Tax Regime. This deduction is not available under the New Tax Regime. Yes, Under the New Tax Regime only the Employer's Contribution towards NPS can be claimed as a deduction u/s 80CCD(2) but only upto 14% of Basic Salary. However, under the Old Tax Regime, NPS contribution by the taxpayer can be claimed as a deduction upto Rs. 1,50,000 u/s 80C. Additional Rs. 50,000 contribution over the 80C limit can be claimed u/s 80CCD(1b). Also the Employer's contribution towards NPS can also be claimed u/s 80CCD(2) but only upto 10% of Basic Salary.
