Know impact of Budget 2025 on different salary levels | Image source: Shutterstock Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed to revised the New Tax Regime slabs and rates for the benefit of the middle-class taxpayers. The new slabs and rates will apply from Financial Year 2025-26 (AY 2026-27). "I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable up to income of ₹12 lakh under the new regime. This limit will be ₹12.75 lakh for salaried taxpayers, due to standard deduction of ₹ 75,000," the FM said. As per the budget proposal, an average income of ₹1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains will become tax-free. "Slabs and rates are being changed across the board to benefit all taxpayers. The new structure will substantially reduce the taxes of the middle class and leave more money in their hands, boosting household consumption, savings and investment," she said.

So this could include income from salary, pension, and bank deposits.
