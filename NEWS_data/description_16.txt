Feedback Income tax savings: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's recent announcement of substantial rebates for middle-income taxpayers under the new tax regime has sparked interest among the middle class on how they can optimise their tax savings. The Budget 2025 has implemented changes to the new tax regime (NTR) to provide relief to the middle class, amounting to Rs 1 lakh crore, while maintaining the old tax regime (OTR) unchanged. The budget now exempts income tax on annual earnings up to Rs 12 lakh (previously Rs 7 lakh), benefiting over one crore taxpayers and reducing the tax burden on others.  With lower tax rates and minimal deductions, the new regime has been structured to simplify taxation, while the old regime continues to offer tax benefits through multiple exemptions and deductions. Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Chairman Ravi Agarwal told Business Today on Monday that around 95-97 per cent of the taxpayers would join the new tax regime from the current 74-75 per cent. He said currently there are 8-8.5 crore taxpayers.   How much tax do I have to pay? Calculate now Let's check tax savings for different salary and tax brackets 1. Rs 15 lakh annual income New Tax Regime Calculation: Gross Income: Rs 15 lakh

0-4 lakh: Nil
4 lakh - 8 lakh: 5% of 4 lakh = Rs 20,000
8 lakh - 12 lakh: 10% of 4 lakh = Rs 40,000
12 lakh - 14.25 lakh: 15% of 2.25 lakh = Rs 33,750 Total tax: Rs 20,000 + Rs 40,000 + Rs 33,750 = Rs 93,750 Cess (4%): Rs 93,750 × 4% = Rs 3,750 Total Tax Liability: Rs 93,750 + Rs 3,750 = Rs 97,500. Old Tax Regime calculation: Gross Income: Rs 15,00,000 Deductions: Standard Deduction: Rs 50,000

5 lakh - 10 lakh: 20% of 5 lakh = Rs 1,00,000 Total tax: Rs 12,500 + Rs 1,00,000 = Rs 1,12,500 Cess (4%): Rs 1,12,500 × 4% = Rs 4,500 Total Tax Liability (Old Regime): Rs 1,12,500 + Rs 4,500 = Rs 1,17,000 Therefore, under New Tax Regime taxpayers earning Rs 15 lakh per annum will pay Rs 97,500 vs Rs 1,17,000 under Old Ta Regime. Therefore, savings of Rs 19,500. 2. Rs 20 lakh income Under the new tax regime, the tax liability is calculated as follows: Income from 0 to 4 lakh: Nil tax
Income from 4 lakh to 8 lakh: 5% of 4 lakh = Rs 20,000
Income from 8 lakh to 12 lakh: 10% of 4 lakh = Rs 40,000
Income from 12 lakh to 16 lakh: 15% of 4 lakh = Rs 60,000
Income from 16 lakh to 19.25 lakh: 20% of 3.25 lakh = Rs 65,000 The total tax to be paid is Rs 20,000 + Rs 40,000 + Rs 60,000 + Rs 65,000 = Rs 1,85,000. Additionally, a Cess of 4% is levied on the total tax amount, which amounts to Rs 1,85,000 x 4% = Rs 7,400. Therefore, the total tax liability under the new regime comes out to be Rs 1,85,000 + Rs 7,400 = Rs 1,92,400.
