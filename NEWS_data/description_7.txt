As a result, people belonging to high-income groups generally bear a higher taxation rate and those belonging to the low or middle-income group have to bear a lesser tax rate. Individuals with a high yearly income generally look for tax-saving measures to reduce their tax burdens. If you are looking for how to save tax on 20 lakhs salary, check out all the tax-saving options you need to know.   The income earned up-to Rs.12 Lakhs will ultimately have Nil tax liability. Here's how! Income Tax Slabs Tax Rate Up-to Rs. 4,00,000 NIL Rs. 4,00,001 - Rs. 8,00,000 5% Rs. 8,00,001 - Rs. 12,00,000 10% Rs. 12,00,001 - Rs. 16,00,000 15% Rs. 16,00,001 - Rs. 20,00,000 20% Rs. 20,00,001 - Rs. 24,00,000 25% Above Rs. 24,00,000 30% As per the latest Finance Act 2024, changes have been made in the slab rate for the new tax regime applicable for FY 24-25 as follows -  Tax Slab  Tax Rate Upto ₹ 3 lakh Nil ₹ 3 lakh - ₹ 7 lakh 5% ₹ 7 lakh - ₹ 10 lakh 10% ₹ 10 lakh - ₹ 12 lakh  15% ₹ 12 lakh - ₹ 15 lakh 20% More than ₹ 15 lakh 30% In the new tax regime, the standard deduction has been increased from Rs.50,000 to Rs.75,000, and the deduction on family pension has also been increased from Rs.15,000 to Rs.25,000.  Individuals opting for the new tax regime have limited scope of claiming exemption or deduction. The main purpose of introducing a new regime is to phase out all the deductions and exemptions available in the Income-tax Act. Compensating such limited exemptions and deductions, taxpayers are provided with a lower tax slab providing them an incentive to switch over to the new regime. However, even in the new regime, taxpayers can still claim certain exemptions or deductions as follows Tax Slab under the old regime are as follows; Tax Slab FY 2024-25 Tax Rate (Old tax regime) Rs. 0 - Rs 2,50,000 0% Rs 2,50,000 – Rs 5,00,000 5% Rs 5,00,000 – Rs 10,00,000 20% Rs 10,00,000 and beyond 30% Note:  Above slab rates are applicable for individuals aged less than 60 years. The basic exemption limit for individuals over 60 years is Rs 300,000, and for individuals aged more than 80 years is Rs 500,000. There are many components in your salary that are exempted from taxes. Furthermore, you are liable for several deductions if you opt for the old tax regime. Thus, your net taxable income will be as follows: Take a look at them below: Salary Components Taxability Basic Pay Fully-taxable Dearness Allowance (DA) Fully-taxable House Rent Allowance (HRA) Exemption up to a certain limit.  Calculate now Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) Actual travel ticket expenses exempt for two  trips in 4 years under 10(5). Read more Mobile/ Internet reimbursement  Exempt if: – used predominantly for office purposes –  proofs/bills submitted Children’s Education and Hostel allowance Rs 4800 per child (max 2 children) Food Expenses Rs 50 per meal (max 2 meals a day)Annual=  Rs 26,400 (50*2*22 days*12 months) Standard Deduction Rs 50,000 (Will be given to all without any restrictions) Professional Tax Generally Rs 2,400 (Varies from state to state) Moreover, when you are tax planning for a salary above 20 lakhs, you can get deductions on the following: Paying health insurance policy premium (Section 80D) Self, your spouse, and your dependent children:  Rs 25,000 (Rs 50,000 if aged 60 and above) Parents: Rs 25,000 (Rs 50,000 if aged 60 and above) Opting for an education loan (Section 80E) Interest deduction for 8 years from the year of repayment of loan taken for the higher education of yourself, your spouse, dependent children, or a student of whom you are the legal guardian Donating  to charity (Section 80G) 50% or 100% of the eligible amount Investing in tax saving instruments  (Section 80C) Tax benefit of Rs.1,50,000 per year.

These are some of the ways in which individuals who earn a salary above Rs 20 lakhs per annum can save on income tax. However, make sure to accurately calculate your tax liability and applicable deductions.

Example: Mr. A has a salary income of Rs 20 lakhs claiming deductions like HRA of Rs. 1,00,000, LTA of Rs. 20,000, Children's education allowance for two children of Rs. 9,600, Professional tax of Rs 2,400. He has also claimed deductions like 80C of Rs. 150,000, 80D - Medical insurance premium of Rs. 25,000, and NPS contribution of Rs 50,000.

In the above calculation, you will observe that based on the investments made by the taxpayer, the tax liability differs in both regimes.
