Know how the new slabs under the new tax regime will benefit salaried taxpayers | Image source: Shutterstock Salaried employees also get a standard deduction of ₹75,000. Thus the new rebate and standard deduction announced by the finance minister make salary income up to ₹12.75 lakh tax-free. The changes announced by the finance minister will apply in the Financial year (FY) 2025-26 or Assessment Year (AY) 2026-27. CA Dr Suresh Surana's post-budget calculations show the budget announcements are set to provide tax benefits to almost all salaried employees opting for the new tax regime. For instance, the proposed tax rates in the new regime will enable 26.35% tax savings for an employee earning ₹25 lakh salary income compared to the existing new regime rates. Similarly, an employee earning a salary of ₹18 lakh will make 30.12% tax savings due to the proposed rates in the new regime. The following illustrations based on Dr Surana's calculation show the percentage tax-savings salaried employees can make due to the proposed slabs in the new regime compared to the previous slab and rates at different income levels. Please note the illustrations are for reference purposes only. Salary income, standard deduction, health and education cess and surcharge have been considered for calculation. However, other forms of income and deductions, have not been considered for calculation. The finance minister has announced no change in the old tax regime. However, as a result of the tax cuts proposal in Budget 2025, the government is expected to lose ₹1 lakh crore revenue in direct
taxes.
